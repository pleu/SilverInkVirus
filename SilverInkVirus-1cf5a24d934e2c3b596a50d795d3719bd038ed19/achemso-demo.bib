	abstract = {This study focuses on the design of highly hydrophobic polyester fabrics (PET) coated with organophilic graphene nanosheets (G-ODA) through a simple, cost-effective and scalable coating method. The organophilic graphene oxide was successfully synthesized by covalently grafting a long chain fatty amine on its surface and was fully characterized by various physicochemical techniques. G-ODA was coated at different loadings onto the PET fabric ranging from 1 to 7 wt\% to produce uniformly dispersed PET@G-ODA fabrics with multifunctional performances. FTIR has confirmed the formation of strong interfacial interaction between the PET and G-ODA functional groups. Moreover, the produced PET@G-ODA fabrics resulted in achieving enhanced thermal stability as well as excellent water repellency compared to the pristine PET. Water contact angle measurements showed a tremendous enhancement of surface hydrophobicity up to 148° with 7 wt\% loading of G-ODA. Tensile strength tests revealed that our fabric exhibited excellent mechanical properties compared to neat PET. In addition, the designed PET@G-ODA fabrics demonstrated excellent oil/water separation efficiency for different oil/water mixtures. The obtained results are very promising in terms of designing and producing functional PET fabrics with improved thermal and surface proprieties.},

	abstract = {The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) is affecting over 210 countries and territories, and it is spreading mainly by respiratory droplets. The use of disposable surgical masks is common for patients, doctors, and even the general public in highly risky areas. However, the current surgical masks cannot self-sterilize in order to reuse or be recycled for other applications. The resulting high economic and environmental costs are further damaging societies worldwide. Herein, we reported a unique method for functionalizing commercially available surgical masks with outstanding self-cleaning and photothermal properties. A dual-mode laser-induced forward transfer method was developed for depositing few-layer graphene onto low-melting temperature nonwoven masks. Superhydrophobic states were observed on the treated masks’ surfaces, which can cause the incoming aqueous droplets to bounce off. Under sunlight illumination, the surface temperature of the functional mask can quickly increase to over 80 °C, making the masks reusable after sunlight sterilization. In addition, this graphene-coated mask can be recycled directly for use in solar-driven desalination with outstanding salt-rejection performance for long-term use. These roll-to-roll production-line-compatible masks can provide us with better protection against this severe virus. The environment can also benefit from the direct recycling of these masks, which can be used for desalinating seawater.},

We here identified the bacteria viability on common face masks and found that the majority of bacteria (90\%) remain alive after 8 h. Using laser-induced graphene (LIG), the inhibition rate improves to ∼81\%. Combined with the photothermal effect, 99.998\% bacterial killing efficiency could be attained within 10 min. For aerosolized bacteria, LIG also showed superior antibacterial capacity. The LIG can be converted from a diversity of carbon precursors including biomaterials, which eases the supply stress and environmental pressure amid an outbreak. In addition, self-reporting of mask conditions is feasible using the moisture-induced electricity from gradient graphene. Our results improve the safe use of masks and benefit the environment.},

	abstract = {A type of nanostructured material comprising reduced graphene oxide (RGO) modified polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for fabric coating is described. RGO modified PDMS was prepared through an aryl radical assisted addition reaction, followed by hydrosilylation with Si–H terminated PDMS or poly(dimethylsiloxane-co-methylhydrosiloxane) (PDMS-co-PHMS) in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pt catalyst. The introduction of a trace amount of RGO to cross-link with PDMS or PDMS-co-PHMS led to a significant improvement in the hydrophobicity (water contact angle {\textgreater} 150°) of textile fabrics. The superhydrophobicity of the fabric coating, which was readily achieved by a facile dipping coating process, is long-term resistant to strong acids, corrosive alkalis, hot water and 200 cycles of laundry. This type of RGO modified PDMS or PDMS-co-PHMS coating materials makes use of the inherent morphological anisotropy of fabrics which latter provides a hierarchical roughness on the micro scale to further enhance the surface hydrophobicity, showing potential use in various textile applications.},

        , According to World Health Organization, every year in the European Union, 4 million patients acquire a healthcare associated infection., Even though some microorganisms represent no threat to healthy people, hospitals harbor different levels of immunocompetent individuals, namely patients receiving immunosuppressors, with previous infections, or those with extremes of age (young children and elderly), requiring the implementation of effective control measures., Public spaces have also been found an important source of infectious disease outbreaks due to poor or none infection control measures applied., In both places, surfaces play a major role on microorganisms’ propagation, yet they are very often neglected, with very few guidelines about efficient cleaning measures and microbiological assessment available., To overcome surface contamination problems, new strategies are being designed to limit the microorganisms’ ability to survive over surfaces and materials., Surface modification and/or functionalization to prevent contamination is a hot-topic of research and several different approaches have been developed lately. Surfaces with anti-adhesive properties, with incorporated antimicrobial substances or modified with biological active metals are some of the strategies recently proposed., This review intends to summarize the problems associated with contaminated surfaces and their importance on infection spreading, and to present some of the strategies developed to prevent this public health problem, namely some already being commercialized.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is endangering the world due to the spread of respiration droplets with viruses. Medical workers and frontline staff need to wear respirators to protect themselves from breathing in the virus-containing respiration droplets. The most frequently used state-of-the-art respirators are of N95 standard; however, they lack self-decontamination capabilities. In addition, the viruses and bacteria can accumulate on the respirator surfaces, possessing high risks to the wearers over long-term usage. Photothermal decontamination is a contactless, fast, low-cost, and widely available method, capable of decontaminating the respirators. Herein, we report a plasmonic photothermal and superhydrophobic coating on N95 respirators, possessing significantly better protection than existing personal protection equipment. The plasmonic heating can raise the surface temperature to over 80 °C for this type of respirator within 1 min of sunlight illumination. The superhydrophobic features prohibit respiration droplets from accumulating on the respirator surfaces. The presence of the silver nanoparticles can provide additional protection via the silver ion’s disinfection toward microbes. These synergistic features of the composite coatings provide the N95 respirator with better protection and can inspire experts from interdisciplinary fields to develop better personal protection equipment to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Health and environmental impacts of graphene-based materials need to be thoroughly evaluated before their potential applications. Graphene has strong cytotoxicity toward bacteria. To better understand its antimicrobial mechanism, we compared the antibacterial activity of four types of graphene-based materials (graphite (Gt), graphite oxide (GtO), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) toward a bacterial model—Escherichia coli. Under similar concentration and incubation conditions, GO dispersion shows the highest antibacterial activity, sequentially followed by rGO, Gt, and GtO. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and dynamic light scattering analyses show that GO aggregates have the smallest average size among the four types of materials. SEM images display that the direct contacts with graphene nanosheets disrupt cell membrane. No superoxide anion (O2*–) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is detected. However, the four types of materials can oxidize glutathione, which serves as redox state mediator in bacteria. Conductive rGO and Gt have higher oxidation capacities than insulating GO and GtO. Results suggest that antimicrobial actions are contributed by both membrane and oxidation stress. We propose that a three-step antimicrobial mechanism, previously used for carbon nanotubes, is applicable to graphene-based materials. It includes initial cell deposition on graphene-based materials, membrane stress caused by direct contact with sharp nanosheets, and the ensuing superoxide anion-independent oxidation. We envision that physicochemical properties of graphene-based materials, such as density of functional groups, size, and conductivity, can be precisely tailored to either reducing their health and environmental risks or increasing their application potentials.},
